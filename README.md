# 🌍 International Debt Analysis — SQL Project

This project explores **international debt data** from the **World Bank**, focusing on the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various debt indicators. The analysis is done using **SQL** and aims to answer critical questions about global debt distribution.

## 📊 Objective

The goal of this project is to use SQL to explore and answer the following:

- 💰 What is the total amount of debt owed by all countries?
- 🏳️ Which country owes the most debt?
- 📈 What is the average amount of debt across various indicators?
- 🔎 How do specific countries compare across different debt types?

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the World Bank and includes:

- `country_name`: Name of the country
- `country_code`: ISO country code
- `indicator_name`: Description of the debt indicator
- `indicator_code`: Code used to represent the indicator
- `debt`: Debt amount (in USD)

The dataset is stored in a SQL table named `international_debt`.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (via SQL magic) or SQL editor**


## 📌 Key SQL Queries

- Total debt owed by all countries
- Country with the highest debt
- Average debt by indicator
- Country-indicator combinations with the highest values

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data querying and aggregation
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING clauses
- Filtering with WHERE and LIKE
